# DataScraping

This is a data scraping program I developed for sportsmodelanalytics.com. It pulls data from a table on the website and uploads that same data to a google drive folder. Abilities of this scraper:

Pull data from a html table
Uses Selenium to give the script the ability to interact with the web page
Uploads the data to a google sheets file.
