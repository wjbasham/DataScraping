# DataScraping

This is a data scraping program I developed for sportsmodelanalytics.com. It pulls data from a table on the website and uploads that same data to a google drive folder. This scraper is able to Pull data from a html table, it uses Selenium to give the script the ability to interact with the web page, and finally uploads the data to a google sheets file. There are four scraping files because there were four different pages I needed to scrape data from.
